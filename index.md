# Hi, I’m Antonis Mavritsakis!
<h2 class="typewriter gold-link">Data Scientist | Researcher | Engineer</h2>

I'm a data scientist, risk analyst, and civil engineer based in Utrecht, The Netherlands. I specialize in combining data-driven methods with engineering insight to tackle complex decision-making challenges. I currently work as a researcher and consultant at Deltares, and I’ve developed open-source tools and models focused on reinforcement learning, statistical inference, and geotechnical reliability.
