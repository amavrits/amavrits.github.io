# Reddit Sentiment Analysis for Stock Price Forecasting

Subreddit *r/wallstreetbets* includes discussions of users about the stock market. This project investigated whether the sentiment expressed in these discussions influences the price of stocks. The analysis started by setting up a Natural Language Processing framework that recognized stock names and quantified the associated sentiment over a collection of *r/wallstreetbets* posts and comments. Following, a linear regression model was deployed to describe the relationship between sentiment score and stock price volatility. Hypothesis testing was used to examine whether the discovered relationships were statistically significant. Eventually, the analysis concluded that no relationship existed after the short squeeze organized by the subreddit in January 2021.
