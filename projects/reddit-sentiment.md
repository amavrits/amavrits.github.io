Using data from the most popular stock-related subreddit, this project performs sentiment analysis to understand how retail investors react to major market events. It's a fascinating intersection of finance, language, and data science.

## Project Highlights

- 📈 **Market Context**: Focuses on periods of market volatility to study emotional and cognitive trends.
- 🕵️ **Sentiment Evolution**: Tracks how public sentiment shifts as financial news breaks and market reactions unfold.
- 📦 **End-to-End Pipeline**: From data scraping to visualization—all done in Python.

## Tech Stack
