# Optimization of Decision-Making for Port Engineering Assets via RL

This project used Q-learning in JAX to optimize structural modifications and maintenance scheduling for port quay walls, based on corrosion data.

**Key Points:**
- Reinforcement (Q-) Learning
- Decision-making support
- Deep Q-Learning in JAX
