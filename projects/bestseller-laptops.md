## ðŸš€ Pipeline Overview

### 1. Scrape Bestselling Laptops
- Source: [Amazon.nl Bestsellers - Laptops](https://www.amazon.nl/gp/bestsellers/electronics/16366027031)
- Data collected: Title, URL, price, rating, and ASIN.
- Output: `data/amazon_top50_laptops.csv`

### 2. Collect Reviews
- For each ASIN, fetch customer reviews using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
- Output: `data/laptop_reviews/{ASIN}.json`

### 3. Summarize Reviews with GPT-4o
- **GPT-4o** is used to extract product-specific **praises** and **complaints**, excluding unrelated content (e.g. shipping, seller).
- Input: JSON reviews per product.
- Output: `results/laptop_review_summaries/{ASIN}.json`

### 4. Merge Summaries with Metadata
- Combines review summaries with price, rating, and ASIN from original CSV.
- Adds brand and model parsed from title.
- Final output: `results/final_laptop_dataset.csv`

## ðŸ’¡ Highlight: GPT-4o Summarization

We use GPT-4o to:
- Parse dozens of user reviews.
- Extract only meaningful, **product-specific** comments.
- Output structured, interpretable summaries for business insight.

This approach avoids noisy data from non-product-related content and makes the dataset highly usable for ML or analysis.

You can use it for downstream analysis, dashboards, or ML pipelines.
