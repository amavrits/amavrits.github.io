Welcome to the **Hunting Game**, an interactive single-player game where you play as the prey or predator against trained AI agents!

This project showcases the power of **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** using a custom environment and agents trained with **Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO)**, all wrapped in a web-based interface.
